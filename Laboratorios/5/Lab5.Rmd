This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}


yield = read.csv("FactorialDesign.csv",
                 header = T,
                 encoding = "UTF-8")
yield <- yield[-1]
plot(yield)
yield
```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
interaction.plot(yield$Temp,yield$Conc,yield$Yield)
interaction.plot(yield$Temp,yield$Catalyst,yield$Yield)
interaction.plot(yield$Conc,yield$Catalyst,yield$Yield) 
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
summary(lm1)
```

```{r}
lm1 = lm(Yield ~ ., data = yield)
summary(lm1)
lm2 = lm(Yield ~ .^2, data = yield)
summary(lm2)

```

```{r}
anova(lm1, lm2)
```

```{r}
lm3 = lm(Yield ~ .^3, data = yield)
summary(lm3)

```

```{r}
lm4 = lm(Yield ~ Conc + Temp*Catalyst, data = yield)
summary(lm4) 

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
